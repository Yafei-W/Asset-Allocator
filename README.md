## Asset Allocator

The Asset Allocator can be used to compute best asset allocation for a taxable financial portfolio to meet the following goals at the same time:
- Market weights on asset classes, asset groups and assets are all within pre-defined tolerance ranges,
- After-tax cash inflow or outflow requirement,
- Apply short term and long term tax rates to both carry-over and allocation capital gains and losses,
- Minimize tax liability to maximize portfolio value after allocation.

Download the zip file of your platform from "Releases" on the right, unzip and run the AssetAllocator script under the bin folder.  Once the program starts, click on the menu item "Help" for further information.  Other folders that contain related information are:
- input: sample input files,
- output: sample output files,
- xsd: schema file for input and output files.

This version of the program is for personal use only.
