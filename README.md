# Asset Allocator

The Asset Allocator is an asset allocation/rebalancing calculator can be used to compute best asset allocation for a taxable financial portfolio to meet the following goals all at the same time:
- Market weights on asset classes, asset groups and assets are all within pre-defined tolerance ranges around target weights,
- After-tax cash inflow or outflow requirement,
- Tax withheld amount on carry-over and allocation capital gains and losses applying both short term and long term capital gain tax rates,
- Minimize tax liability to maximize portfolio value after allocation.
